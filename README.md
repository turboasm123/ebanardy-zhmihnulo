# Ebanardy Zhmihnulo is the automated cat pics ruiner, firstly designed for VKontakte, now it is a public domain.
(Yeah, you would wish it wasn't.)




What does Ebanardy Zhmihnulo do and how to operate it?

Ebanardy Zhmihnulo is a bunch of scripts:

1.Shakal.py is the cat pics ruiner that gets its pictures from images_db folder.

2.checkfiles.py is the script that checks if the file count is below 100 and automatically downloads pictures from websites.

3.porn.py uploads the result of Shakal script to the VK public group.

# Getting started

Ebanardy Zhmihnulo uses PIL and vk_api Python 3 modules, so install them with pip.

Clone the repository and run checkfiles.py to update the images database.Then, run Shakal.py and ruin the cat picture.Then, you can either upload it anywhere on your own or set up porn.py (by configuring everything there) and run it to upload the picture to the VK public group.

I dunno, what to write here more.It's a really simple script just made for lulz.
